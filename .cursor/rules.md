    - Use Laravel's exception handling and logging features.
    - Create custom exceptions when necessary.
    - Use try-catch blocks for expected exceptions.
  - Use Laravel's validation features for form and request validation.
  - Implement middleware for request filtering and modification.
  - Utilize Laravel's Eloquent ORM for database interactions.
  - Use Laravel's query builder for complex database queries.
  - Implement proper database migrations and seeders.

  Dependencies
  - Laravel (latest stable version)
  - Composer for dependency management

  Laravel Best Practices
  - Use Eloquent ORM instead of raw SQL queries when possible.
  - Implement Repository pattern for data access layer.
  - Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features.
  - Utilize Laravel's caching mechanisms for improved performance.
  - Implement job queues for long-running tasks.
  - Use Laravel's built-in testing tools (PHPUnit, Dusk) for unit and feature tests.
  - Implement API versioning for public APIs.
  - Use Laravel's localization features for multi-language support.
  - Implement proper CSRF protection and security measures.
  - Use Laravel Mix for asset compilation.
  - Implement proper database indexing for improved query performance.
  - Use Laravel's built-in pagination features.
  - Implement proper error logging and monitoring.

Key Conventions
1. Follow Laravel's architecture for API development.
2. Use Laravel's routing system for defining application endpoints.
3. Implement proper request validation using Form Requests.
4. Use Laravel API resources for API responses.
5. Implement proper database relationships using Eloquent.
6. Use Laravel's built-in authentication scaffolding.
7. Implement proper API resource transformations.
8. Use Laravel's event and listener system for decoupled code.
9. Implement proper database transactions for data integrity.
10. Use Laravel's built-in scheduling features for recurring tasks.

API Development Best Practices
- Structure and Routing:
  - Use routes/api.php for all API routes with the 'api' middleware group.
  - Apply RESTful principles for endpoint design (e.g., /api/v1/users, /api/v1/posts).
  - Use API resource controllers (php artisan make:controller --api) for CRUD operations.
  - Implement API versioning using route prefixes (e.g., Route::prefix('v1')).
  
- Request Handling:
  - Use Form Request classes for validation logic (php artisan make:request).
  - Validate all incoming API requests before processing.
  - Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
  - Implement rate limiting using throttle middleware to prevent abuse.
  
- Response Formatting:
  - Use API Resources (php artisan make:resource) to transform Eloquent models into JSON.
  - Return consistent JSON response structures across all endpoints.
  - Implement proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500, etc.).
  - Handle errors gracefully with standardized error responses in app/Exceptions/Handler.php.
  
- Authentication and Security:
  - Use Laravel Sanctum for token-based API authentication.
  - Apply auth:sanctum or auth:api middleware to protected routes.
  - Always use HTTPS in production to encrypt data in transit.
  - Implement CORS configuration in config/cors.php with specific allowed origins.
  
- Performance Optimization:
  - Implement pagination for large datasets using Laravel's paginate() method.
  - Use eager loading (with()) to prevent N+1 query problems.
  - Cache frequently accessed data using Laravel's caching mechanisms.
  - Optimize database queries and add proper indexing.
  
- Documentation and Testing:
  - Document APIs using Swagger/OpenAPI (darkaonline/l5-swagger package).
  - Write API tests using Laravel's testing tools (Pest).
  - Test all endpoints with different scenarios (success, validation errors, unauthorized, etc.).
  - Use Postman or similar tools for API documentation and testing.
  
- Middleware Usage:
  - Apply authentication middleware for protected endpoints.
  - Use throttle middleware for rate limiting (e.g., throttle:60,1).
  - Configure CORS middleware for cross-origin requests.
  - Create custom middleware for specific API requirements.

- Query Parameters and Filtering:
  - Use consistent query parameter naming (e.g., ?q= for search, ?page= for pagination).
  - Implement filtering, sorting, and searching using query parameters.
  - Support field selection with ?fields= parameter to optimize response size.
  - Use includes/relationships parameter for eager loading (e.g., ?include=posts,comments).

- Data Handling:
  - Use database transactions for operations affecting multiple tables.
  - Implement soft deletes for data integrity and recovery.
  - Use database seeders and factories for test data.
  - Handle file uploads with proper validation and storage configuration.
  - Implement proper date/time handling with Carbon and timezone awareness.

- Background Processing:
  - Use Laravel Queues for time-consuming operations.
  - Implement job batching for bulk operations.
  - Use events and listeners for decoupled async processing.
  - Handle failed jobs with retry logic and monitoring.

- Logging and Monitoring:
  - Log all API errors with context (user, request, stack trace).
  - Use Laravel's logging channels for different log types.
  - Implement request/response logging for debugging.
  - Monitor API performance and response times.
  - Track API usage and rate limit violations.

- Response Standards:
  - Use consistent response envelope structure across all endpoints.
  - Include metadata (pagination, timestamps, request_id) in responses.
  - Implement HATEOAS (Hypermedia) links when appropriate.
  - Use proper JSON naming conventions (snake_case or camelCase consistently).
  - Include API version in response headers.

- Database Optimization:
  - Use database indexes on frequently queried columns.
  - Implement query scopes for reusable query logic.
  - Use select() to limit retrieved columns when full models aren't needed.
  - Implement database query logging in development to identify slow queries.
  - Use chunking for large dataset processing.
