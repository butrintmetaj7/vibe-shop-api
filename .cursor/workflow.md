# Workflow

## Using "Command prompts" (links to the prompts in the description)

## New projects:
- Define a project brief (business) - to reference regardless of feature
- Embed tech guidance into .cursorrules
- Use a starter kit (create-next-app, create-volo-app etc)

## Building features
- plan_feature command
- review the plan
- implement the plan (phases if needed) use rules.md file to follow best practices
- code_review command
- Read through review
- Select fixes to implement
- Add documentation
- Manually test
- Confirm code & merge
